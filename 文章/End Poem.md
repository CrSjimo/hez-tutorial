# End Poem

吾持尔谓的游戏者见及。
Mi ze nes nyabik ïuqize betlu.
***I see the player you mean.***

【游戏者的名】？
[ïuqize'd tido]?
***PLAYERNAME?***

So。注意兮付xite。彼持较高境界至已达及。彼持吾们的思想读可。
So. Juï ïa buexite. Tat ze gen vieto gioka do deitigalu. Tat ze mimen'd seso ïa lidna.
***Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts.***

无风。彼持吾们兮此游戏中之分部ïximada谓。
Dūmasa. Tat ze mimen ïa zig ïuqi zaren de dimi ïximada nya.
***That doesn't matter. It thinks we are part of the game.***

吾持此游戏者好。彼良是行。彼不曾半途而废。
Mi ze zig ïuqize sиo. Tat holuhavye zom. Tat dūz pesen pantoïepye.
***I like this player. It played well. It did not give up.***

彼持吾们的思想兹似当阅，其持画面中之文字so之。
Tat ze mimen'd seso tas mio dyalid, tos ze nyaman zaren de monji so de.
***It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.***

彼持游戏之梦奥是于之时于，其方以多数事物兮想象。
Tat ze ïuqi de juynto dephavye za de ta za, tos dyu ïo deli ro ïa sojon.
***That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in the dream of a game.***

文字持素晴互面成ïximada持。甚伸缩自如so矣。画面后之现实注视与较低恐惧的so矣。
Monji ze subalaxi kejman sen ïximada ze. Hin xinxyujiru so sae. Nyaman äza de sansei juxi zue gendeli kiungubik so sae.
***Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen.***

彼们阅上手能够之前，持声音曾经闻。忆往昔，不游戏之人持其游戏者巫道者ïximada谓。其游戏者持空兮飞介过，魔杖兮乘之梦兮立。
Tatmen lidsansonotes de qaza, ze nya pesen mi. Petatedo, dūz ïuqi de pūp ze tos ïuqize mudoze ïximada nya. Tos ïuqize ze hoto ïa fye te duru, majo ïa dege de juynto ïa lye.
***They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons.***

何物兮此游戏者持梦兮立欤？
Φиro ïa zig ïuqize ze juynto ïa lye sūs?
***What did this player dream?***

此游戏者持日光，树和水之梦兮立。彼持创造和破坏之梦，狩猎和受狩猎之梦，难避处之梦兮立。
Zig ïuqize ze naelit, mut ö des de juynto lye. Tat ze sozo ö hokuye de juynto, xyulye ö betisxyulye de juynto, nanpili de juynto ïa lye.
***This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.***

噫，本初互面so矣。百万年间，其仍干活。然而，画面后之现实于，此游戏者持何真实的结构兮创造了？
Φu, bonzu kejman so sae. Binnaluya siaüi zarin, tat sulu ganho. Foites, nyaman äza de sansei za, zig ïuqize ze φиo zenseibik kego ïa sozope?
***Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen?***

彼持数百万其他与兹来干活，【sиkrambиled】之叠中之一真实的世界兮刻画，以及【sиkrambиled】中【sиkrambиled】所一【sиkrambиled】兮创造。
Tat ze dasuye binnaluya tosta zue tas la ganho, [sиkrambиled] de tak zaren de nūn zenseibik seka ïa kienya, öites [sиkrambиled] zaren [sиkrambиled] ve nūn [sиkrambиled] ïa sozo.
***It worked, with a million others, to sculpt a true world in a fold of the [scrambled], and created a [scrambled] for [scrambled], in the [scrambled].***

彼持siad思想阅不能够。
Tat ze siad seso liddūznotes.
***It cannot read that thought.***

So，彼持极高境界至不已达及。Siad所来，彼持人生之长梦，非游戏之短梦必达成。
So, tat ze zuye vieto gioka do dūzdeitigalu. Siad ve la, tat ze rensen de delilen juynto, dūso ïuqi de lidelen juynto kanyiäqiv.
***No. It has not yet achieved the highest level. That, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game.***

***Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?***

***Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yes.***

***But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.***

***To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its own private task. We cannot interfere.***

***Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.***

***It reads our thoughts.***

***Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely [scrambled] and [scrambled], I wish to tell them that they are [scrambled] in the [scrambled]. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.***

***And yet they play the game.***

***But it would be so easy to tell them...***

***Too strong for this dream. To tell them how to live is to prevent them living.***

***I will not tell the player how to live.***

***The player is growing restless.***

***I will tell the player a story.***

***But not the truth.***

***No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked truth that can burn over any distance.***

***Give it a body, again.***

***Yes. Player...***

***Use its name.***

***PLAYERNAME. Player of games.***

***Good.***

***Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return. Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream. There you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things.***

***Who are we? Once we were called the spirit of the mountain. Father sun, mother moon. Ancestral spirits, animal spirits. Jinn. Ghosts. The green man. Then gods, demons. Angels. Poltergeists. Aliens, extraterrestrials. Leptons, quarks. The words change. We do not change.***

***We are the universe. We are everything you think isn't you. You are looking at us now, through your skin and your eyes. And why does the universe touch your skin, and throw light on you? To see you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a story.***

***Once upon a time, there was a player.***

***The player was you, PLAYERNAME.***

***Sometimes it thought itself human, on the thin crust of a spinning globe of molten rock. The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty million kilometres away.***

***Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience.***

***Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.***

***Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third.***

***Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen.***

***Let's go back.***

***The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body.***

***And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother's body, into the long dream.***

***And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love.***

***You are the player. The story. The program. The human. Made from nothing but milk and love.***

***Let's go further back.***

***The seven billion billion billion atoms of the player's body were created, long before this game, in the heart of a star. So the player, too, is information from a star. And the player moves through a story, which is a forest of information planted by a man called Julian, on a flat, infinite world created by a man called Markus, that exists inside a small, private world created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by...***

***Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that was soft and warm and simple. Sometimes hard, and cold, and complicated. Sometimes it built a model of the universe in its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks "electrons" and "protons".***

***Sometimes it called them "planets" and "stars".***

***Sometimes it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game. Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen.***

***You are the player, reading words...***

***Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive***

***You. You. You are alive.***

***and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees***

***and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the light that fell from the crisp night sky of winter, where a fleck of light in the corner of the player's eye might be a star a million times as massive as the sun, boiling its planets to plasma in order to be visible for a moment to the player, walking home at the far side of the universe, suddenly smelling food, almost at the familiar door, about to dream again***

***and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream***

***and the universe said I love you***

***and the universe said you have played the game well***

***and the universe said everything you need is within you***

***and the universe said you are stronger than you know***

***and the universe said you are the daylight***

***and the universe said you are the night***

***and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you***

***and the universe said the light you seek is within you***

***and the universe said you are not alone***

***and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing***

***and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code***

***and the universe said I love you because you are love.***

***And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.***

***You are the player.***

***Wake up.
